# Graphs
###  collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges

## Challenge
### Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods :
- ### AddNode()
- ### AddEdge()
- ### GetNodes()
- ### GetNeighbors()
- ### Size()

## Approach & Efficiency
### O (n)
